    "# **Description of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just before the World Cup, a news story was shared on social media. The content of the news was a simulation about the winner of this World Cup. The news was as follows: \"EA Sports, the FIFA game company, simulated the World Cup in FIFA 23 and Argentina became the champion. EA has correctly predicted the champion in three previous simulations. Lionel Messi won both the Golden Ball and the Golden Boot in the simulation.\" With the interest and curiosity generated by this news, we thought about how we could adapt a similar problem with statistical inferences to our own question. Indeed, how effective were parameters such as data from the FIFA game, player strengths, etc. in predicting the outcome? And what kind of results could we have achieved in our project with this mindset? In the light of these questions, we decided to make a Data Science project to predict the Turkish Super League champion in the 2022/2023 season. Subsequently, we will try to predict the 2022-2023 season by creating a league result prediction model for the past years based on the data of the FIFA game, comparing it with the real-life results and seeing how much predictive power we get. In addition to the data from the FIFA game, we will examine the correlation of the market values of the players we get from Transfermarkt and the correlation of the spectator capacity of the matches played with the league result. \n",
    "\n",
    "And how do we include these player overalls into our forecasts? Do these teams' player overalls actually provide any insight towards the actual scores? We will use linear regression to incorporate these predictions into an algorithm. As is totally obvious, linear regression enables us to predict a variable as a function of other factors. However, it's crucial to note that the impact of the independent variables on the predicted variable is produced by supposing a linear connection. Additionally, it is clear that players with high player overalls are often skilled players. Consequently, we make the assumption that a player's overall performance in the game and their real talent are linearly related. We will utilize linear regression to deal with this problem because we view it to be the best suitable regression technique for data that is presumed to have a linear relationship. However, the effectiveness of linear regression may suffer if there is a non-linear relationship. By establishing forecasts based on previous years and contrasting them with the actual league outcomes, we will accomplish this for each year separately. These test results will provide us with a confidence interval even though the test power for one regression is inconclusive for the other test.\n"

These sources are then classified in such a way that they can be used at the most optimal level in the project, if necessary, details that will not be used are removed and a clean data set is obtained. With the data set we have ready, we evaluate how we can use this data in our project and then start the analysis with the necessary statistical methods.
